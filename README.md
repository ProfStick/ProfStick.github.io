# Welcome!

## This site isn't ready!!!

### I am still playing around with style sheets and stuff

That's why the colours are so awful - so I can see the different blocks

so go way and come back later

While I am playing with styles and fonts, because this is a technical site, it is important that I choose a font where I is distinguishable from l.

This site is just an idiosyncratic collection of resources for software and science, particularly physics, I have made over the years.

It is also a testament to entropy so, while I will endeavour to keep it up to date and reasonably well indexed, I can't make promises.

Now that you are here feel free to look around using the index on the left - except that I haven't done the index yet so try going straight to the [Physics page](/docs/physics/index.md)

In the future I hope to link all the resources to outcomes in the NSW School syllabus, but I also hope to build an inverted pendulum and learn to ride a unicycle, so don't get your hopes up.

[don't press on this link it is only my template](/docs/g2u_template.html)
